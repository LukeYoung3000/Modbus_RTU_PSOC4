 * This file defines the timeing related functions used by modbus.h/c and 
 * modbus-local.h . The functions are all specfic to the PSOC 4200 micro
 * controller and require the timer counter component in the PSOC creator 
 * project to have the exact name "MODBUS_TIMER" additionally, the attached 
 * timer overflow external interrupt MUST be named "MODBUS_TIMEOUT".
 * 
 * When porting the libray, all the functions in this this file 
 * MUST be adapted to the API of the micro controller architecture you are
 * useing.
