 * @details
 * This file defines the UART related functions used by modbus.h/c and 
 * modbus-local.h . The functions are all specfic to the PSOC 4200 micro
 * controller and require the UART component in the PSOC creator 
 * project to have the exact name "RS485" additionally, the attached 
 * rx interrupt MUST be named "RS485_RX_ISR".
 * 
 * In order to buffer/store incoming UART data this file uses the ring_buf_s
 * data type from Kim Taylor's ringbuffer.h .
 * 
 * When porting the libray, all the functions in this this file 
 * MUST be adapted to the API of the micro controller architecture you are
 * useing.
